huffmancode

This program enables compression/decompression through huffman code.

All output/input files are contained in the "files" folder

Text to be compressed should be written into "textfile"

Compressed file is "encoded_huffman", it's generally not readable except to decode it.

Decompressed file is named "decoded"

Another file has been made available for those who are curious to the process of compressing/decompressing:

"readable_binary_huffman": A readable huffman code file of textfile, with 1's and 0's'

The compression ratio for relatively large files (like above 10+ KB) is somewhere less than 2.

The runtime efficiency isn't very satisfying.

Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated!
